# Installation

### Requirements
All the codes are tested in the following environment:
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 14.04/16.04/18.04/20.04/21.04)
* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.1 or higher (tested on PyTorch 1.1, 1,3, 1,5~1.10)
* CUDA 9.0 or higher (PyTorch 1.3+ needs CUDA 9.2+)
* [`spconv v1.0 (commit 8da6f96)`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv/tree/8da6f967fb9a054d8870c3515b1b44eca2103634) or [`spconv v1.2`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv) or [`spconv v2.x`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv)


### Install

a. Clone this repository.


b. Install the dependent libraries as follows:

* Install the SparseConv library, we use the implementation from [`[spconv]`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv). 
    * If you use PyTorch 1.1, then make sure you install the `spconv v1.0` with ([commit 8da6f96](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv/tree/8da6f967fb9a054d8870c3515b1b44eca2103634)) instead of the latest one.
    * If you use PyTorch 1.3+, then you need to install the `spconv v1.2`. As mentioned by the author of [`spconv`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv), you need to use their docker if you use PyTorch 1.4+. 
    * You could also install latest `spconv v2.x` with pip, see the official documents of [spconv](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv).
* Install the torch-scatter library, we use the the implementation from [`[pytorch_scatter]`](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter).
  
c. Install this library and its dependent libraries by running the following command:
```shell
python setup.py develop
```
d. We recommend the users to check the version of numba. We find using numba==0.48.0 can significantly save memory.
